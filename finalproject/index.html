<h1>History:</h1>
<p> Many scientists believe that our ancestors diets may have been much more plant based then we realize. an article by National Geographic 
even claims that " Itâ€™s true that hunter-gatherers around the world crave meat more than any other food and usually get around 30 percent 
of their annual calories from animals. But most also endure lean times when they eat less than a handful of meat each week." It's likely
 that over 70% of their diet was plant based. It wasn't until a while later that we have records of people intentionaly not eating meat.
People hav been choosing not to eat animal-based products since over 2,000 years ago! Pythagoras, known by many as the Father of Vegitarianism
 was alive during the 6th century BCE. There are also many religions that promote vegetarianism, such as, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.
 In recent years vegetarianism has become more and more popular and it is estimated that there are 1.5 billion vegetarians on earth, 
 that's approximately 22% of the worlds population!</p>
